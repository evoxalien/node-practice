# Python Basic Kata

## 1. Variables

### Define Vars

1. Define a integer
2. Define a second integer
3. Print both integers
4. Type cast a integer variable from 1 or 2 into a float and print it.

## 2. Basic Built in functions

### Use the following built in functions

1. typeof()
2. console.log()
3. parseInt()
4. toString()
5. parseFloat()
6. toFixed()
7. length()

## 3. List

### List Challenges

1. Define a list with 1 string, 1 int and 1 float

3. Define a emply list
4. Reverse the order of the list from 1., do it 2 different ways (Did the list from 1 reverse?)
5. Create a list of numbers from 0-9
```
numlist = list(range(10))
```
6. output only the first 3 elements of numlist
7. output only the last 3 elements of numlist
8. output every other element of numlist
9. output numlist backwards
10.  Loop through numlist and print every element

## 3. Dict

### Dict Challenges

1. Define a dict with 2 key pairs make sure one of the keys is 'fuel'
2. Print the value for key 'fuel' of the dict from 1.
3. Print the entire dictionary.
4. Define another dict with 2 or more key pairs
5. Add a key pair to the dictionary from step 4.
6. Define a empty Dict
7. Combine dicts from 1 and 2 into one new dict
8. Loop through all element of the dict from 2. and print the keys and values
